**Software Development Project:** Interactive Application with Mini-Games
**Development Platform:** Microsoft Visual Studio

**Programming Language:** C# (Implementation based on OOP principles)

**Project Overview:**

I designed and implemented an entertainment application that seamlessly blends interactive narrative elements with a series of mini-games (levels), integrated into a single, cohesive user experience. The project's logical structure is divided into two primary branches, offering the player an initial choice that determines the narrative arc and the specific set of challenges. All in-game instructions and user interface information are presented in English.

**Theme and Creative Vision:**

The central theme explores the dynamic between a female bunny and a fox, offering two completely opposing narrative perspectives, selectable at the start of the game:

**"Fox+Bunny" (The Illusion):** A love story, symbolizing the possibility of overcoming the impossible.

**"Fox-Bunny" (The Realism):** A classic predator-prey narrative, focused on survival.

**Thematic Motivation:** The choice between these two antagonistic options encourages the player to reflect on the balance between idealism (the possibility of an improbable relationship) and pragmatism (the reality of nature).

**Mini-Game Structure (Levels):**

The application includes three mini-games that require keyboard control, while transitions between the comic strip sequences and the games are managed via mouse interaction (buttons such as "Start," "Go," etc.).

**The project contains two narrative branches, each with specific mini-games:**

**1. "Love" Branch / "Fox+Bunny" (2 mini-games)**

_Level 1:_ The Maze: The player controls the bunny (using the arrow keys) to navigate a maze and reach a portal. Progression requires a mouse click on the "Done" button.

_Level 2:_ Carrot Hunt: This level follows directly after The Maze. The player uses the arrow keys to control the fox avatar, with the goal of collecting 11 carrots. After collection, the game automatically transitions to the final page of this section.

**2. "Survival" Branch / "Fox-Bunny" (1 mini-game)**

_Level 3: The Chase:_ The player maneuvers the bunny (with the arrow keys) to evade the foxes within a set time limit.

-Success (time expiration) results in a message displaying the collected carrot score, followed by a thank-you screen.

-Failure (capture) gives the player the option to restart the level.
